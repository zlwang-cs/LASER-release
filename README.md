# LASER

This is the pytorch implemention for the ACL '22 Finding paper [Towards Few-shot Entity Recognition in Document Images: A Label-aware Sequence-to-Sequence Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05819).

## Quick Start

See `requirements.txt` (Generated by `pipreqs`. If there are any issues, please contact us :)

### Pretrained Weight

Please download the pre-trained weight of LayoutReader from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/layoutreader) or [here](https://layoutlm.blob.core.windows.net/readingbank/model/layoutreader-base-readingbank.zip), and copy `pytorch_model.bin` into `./weights/layoutreader/`.

### Train & Decode & Evaluate FUNSD
```
git clone https://github.com/zlwang-cs/LASER-release.git
cd LASER-release
mkdir outputs
cd shell_scripts
sh run_few_shot_FUNSD.sh 0
```
*The digit after the last line is the ID of GPU you want to use.*

## Your Customed Dataset

### Required Format

Each dataset involves three files, and please put them in a folder under `/data`
1. `meta.json`
2. `train/test-text-s2s.jsons`
3. `train/test-layout-s2s.jsons`

#### Dataset Meta (A json file describing the dataset information)
Contains the following attributes:
1. `labels`: The entity types
2. `words`: The words used in the labels
3. `tokens`: The tokens used in the labels (To achieve better performance, please use simple label words so that each label only involves single token)
4. `token_dict`: A dictionary mapping the token to the token index
5. `next_token_dict`: A dictionary mapping the token to the possible following token (Refer to the provided dataset, FUNSD, to see the example)

#### File for text data (`train-text-s2s.jsons` and `test-text-s2s.jsons` for train/test respectively). 
Each line is a json object which has 4 attributes:
1. `src`: The input text
2. `tgt`: The input text embeddded with tags: `<BEGIN> Sender <END> question <TAG_END>`
3. `filename`: Name of the file
4. `part_idx`: Given that a file is too long or augmented into multiple samples, there will be several pieces of inputs from the same file. We name them sequentially.

#### File for layout data (`train-layout-s2s.jsons` and `test-layout-s2s.jsons` for train/test respectively). 
Each line is a json object which has 4 attributes:
1. `src`: A list of normalized bounding boxes. Each box corresponds to a word in the `src` of the text part. `[[335, 154, 389, 169],...]`
2. `tgt`: A list of normalized bounding boxes. Each box corresponds to a word in the `tgt` of the text part. The special tags are as follows:
- `<BEGIN>`: [1001, 1001, 1001, 1001]
- `<END>`: [1002, 1002, 1002, 1002]
- `<TAG_END>`: [1003, 1003, 1003, 1003]
- the entity type labels: [1004, 1004, 1004, 1004], ...
3. `w`: the original width of the page
4. `h`: the original height of the page

### Few-shot Info

A json file under `data_utils`
```
{
  "1": {                // the number of shots
    "1":                // the random seed used to generate this few-shot list
      [ "A" ],'         // the exact filenames in this list
    "2": 
      [ "B" ],
    ...
  }
}
```
